# OrbitSimulator

OrbitSimulator is a Python tool designed to simulate and visualize satellite orbits. It accounts for basic gravitational forces and offers options for including various perturbations to the orbit, providing a more realistic simulation experience.

## Features

- 2D orbit simulation around Earth
- Visualization of satellite trajectories
- Option to include Earth's oblateness effect (J2 perturbation)
- Utilizes Runge-Kutta 4th order method for accurate numerical integration

## Installation

To use OrbitSimulator, you'll need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arkay92/OrbitSimulator.git
cd OrbitSimulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
